abstract: Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) has enormous potential in the field of Integrated Circuit (IC) due to its programmability, short design cycle, and high flexibility in parallel computing. Nevertheless, increasing chip integration and shrinking transistor size lead to non-negligible power dissipation in FPGA. Specifically, leakage power dissipation issue as a crucial part of power consumption in FPGA requires being concerned urgently. In this paper, a time-based leakage-power aware algorithm (TBLA) is proposed to address the aforementioned issue on 2D dynamic partial reconfigurable FPGA. Experimental results show that the proposed TBLA algorithm reduces the leakage-power and scheduling overhead without increasing the overall execution time of an application compared to traditional algorithms.
