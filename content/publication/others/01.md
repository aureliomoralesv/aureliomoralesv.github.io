abstract: This paper proposes a high-level synthesis approach applicable to future autonomous systems, i.e. embedded systems, in the context of domain-specific architectures (DSA) along with domain-specific languages (DSL). That enables the system’s design and specification to focus on the functions and requirements that such a system must provide and, at the same time, obtain an executable model. We show an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential and applicability of our approach down to automatic hardware description language generation and synthesis.
