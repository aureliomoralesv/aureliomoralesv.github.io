abstract: This research work shows the design and implementation of a Hopfield Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for pattern recovery, starting from noisy patterns, and based on highly complex programmable devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Two artificial neural networks were designed, one basic on a FLEX10K FPGA from Altera, and the advanced one on a Cyclone II FPGA from Altera, making use of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software tools and Hardware Description Language (HDL).
