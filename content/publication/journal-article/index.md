abstract: Gas turbines are thermoelectric plants with various applications, such as large-scale electricity production, petrochemical industry, and steam generation. In order to optimize the operation of a gas turbine, it is necessary to develop system identification models that allow for the development of studies and analyses to increase the system’s reliability. Current strategies for modeling complex and non-linear systems can be based on artificial intelligence techniques, using autoregressive neural networks of the NARX and LSTM type. In this context, this work aims to develop a model of a gas turbine capable of estimating the rotation speed of the turbine and simultaneously estimating the uncertainty associated with the estimation. These methodologies are based on artificial neural networks and the Monte Carlo dropout simulation method. The results were obtained from experimental data from a 215 MW gas turbine, getting the best model with a MAPE of 0.02\% and an uncertainty associated with the turbine rotation speed of 2.2 RPM.

abstract: Partial reconfiguration (PR) of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) enables hardware tasks to time multiplex PR regions (PRRs) by isolating reconfiguration to only the reconfigured PRR, which avoids halting the entire FPGA's execution. Time multiplexing PRRs requires support for unloading/loading tasks and for resuming a task's execution state. In order to resume a task's execution state, the execution state (context) must be saved when the task is unloaded so that the execution state can be restored when the task resumes- context save (CS) and context restore (CR), respectively. In this paper, we present a software-based, on-chip context save and restore (CSR) for PR-capable FPGAs. As compared to prior work, our CSR is autonomous (i.e., does not require any external host support), does not require custom on-chip hardware, is portable across any system design, and does not require tool flow modifications or special tools. Experimental results extensively evaluate the CSR execution time based on PRR size, enabling designers to trade off PRR granularity for CSR execution time based on application requirements.
